# CS 320 Module Eight Journal – Portfolio Reflection
**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

I make sure my code is functional and secure by using a mix of unit testing, code reviews, and validation for all user inputs. Writing JUnit tests throughout development helps me catch logic errors early and confirm that updates don’t break existing functionality. I also validate edge cases and apply exception handling to prevent unexpected crashes or unsafe behavior. For security, I follow best practices like limiting data exposure, avoiding hard-coded values, and testing for incorrect input or data injection.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I start by translating requirements into clear, testable features. For example, when building the Contact Service, I used the customer’s rules (character limits, required fields, unique IDs) to guide both my code and my test cases. I try to think from the user’s perspective—what would make the system intuitive, reliable, and predictable? Regularly reviewing and testing against the original requirements helps ensure that the end product actually meets user expectations.

**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach software design with a modular and test-driven mindset. I focus on keeping each class responsible for one purpose and build test cases alongside the code. This helps me spot dependencies and improve maintainability. I like to plan with diagrams or pseudocode before writing, so I understand how each part connects. My goal is always clean, simple design that’s easy to update and verify through testing.
